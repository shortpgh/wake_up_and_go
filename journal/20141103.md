Today I started to run through the tour of go. Some notes that I picked out are below. https://tour.golang.org

Got to https://tour.golang.org/#29

* names must be capitalized to be exportable in a package.
* functions can return multiple values by separateing them with commas.
** IE., return x, y
** retireve using x, y := Func(z)
** must include the return type in the function declaration
*** I.E., Func(z int) (int, int)
* when declaring variables, if you give it a value, you don't have to declare the type. it assumes the type of the value given to it.
* T(v) converts the value v to the type T.
* const Truth = true // constants don't have the :=
* Variables declared by the if statement are only in scope until the end of the if.
* the := is only used when declaring variables.
* A struct is a collection of fields.

go basic types:
* bool
* string
* int  int8  int16  int32  int64
* uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64 uintptr
* byte // alias for uint8
* rune // alias for int32, represents a Unicode code point
* float32 float64
* complex64 complex12

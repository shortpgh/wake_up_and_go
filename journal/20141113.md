Today is my third attempt at a binary search algorithm.

Like yesterday, I started with a copy of my second attempt.

Today, I'm going to build a struct to manage the search. This probably isn't the best real way to do this, but it will get me familiar with Strtucts and writing functions for them.

This one was fairly easy to write. I used the for loop from the first algorithm as the primary code in this example, but with the error message from two.go.

The struct was easy to define, and most of the work after that was updating variable names to point to the struct instead of local variables. I used sed in acme to do this task. 

I like how sed works in acme -- it's easy to select the parts of the code that I want to be modified, and run sed only on that chunk of code. I also set my GOPATH before opening acme, so I was able to run the test in acme. While I didn't try to time it, i think that sped up my process significantly. I didn't have to change to a term and have a file reopen every time I wanted to run my test. Now that i've gotten this far with acme, i need to look into building a watch mechanism. I also want to find ways to pull in the other tools that I can use in go, like the linter.

Next, I'm going to try to write the code to run on the array directly. This should be similar to the struct, except the low/high/mid variables will be moved back inside of the function.

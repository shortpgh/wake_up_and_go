After a few days away, I'm getting back into the golang tour with an attempt to finish that up. I ran through a few more pages since my last journal entry, but I haven't spent significant time that required, or had time for, a journal entry.

I'm starting today from https://tour.golang.org/#44

I got to https://tour.golang.org/#62

Overall, I'm still impressed with go's simplicity and ease of building the small tutorial applications. I'm going to skim the rest of the tour later today so that i can try to do a program outside of the tour. I need to stretch myself and try to work on a different problem. I also want to get used to working locally instead of using the web running program.

Notes:

* Switch without a condition is the same as switch true. This construct can be a clean way to write long if-then-else chains.

* Go does not have classes. However, you can define methods on struct types. In fact, you can define a method on any type you define in your package, not just structs.
	func (f MyFloat) Abs() float64 { ... }

* The fmt package's various print routines automatically know to call the Error() method when asked to print an error.

* the webserver example is easy. but to make changes, it requires re-building the program. I wonder how that is solved in go.

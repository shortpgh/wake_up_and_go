This morning, I'm writing a binary search algorithm recursively instead of using a for loop.

To start, I'm copying the files from one and modifying those to make them work. This gives me the same test case to pass and already working code to refactor.

It took a little longer than expected, but I was able to convert it. I was also able to use the two return values to pass back an error message when an item isn't found.

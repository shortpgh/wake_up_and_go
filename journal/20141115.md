Today is the fourth iteration of the binary search algorithm. I already decided that I'm going to try to make this an extension of the array data type.


It ended up being very easy to do this. You can't create methods that work on basic types, which I didn't realize until I tried to do this on an int. Instead, I created a new type and made it an int array. While this wasn't hard, it is'nt a great real-world solution. But, that's not the point of this exercise. The point was to learn more about golang, which I did infact do.

My next attempt will be to remove the if statements with a switch in the main program algorithm. Unless I come up with another way to write it in the meantime.

=Day  1:  2014-11-01

Today is mainly a setup day. 

Because I'm trying to learn acme as well, it's been a lot of tinkering with the setup. I also spent some time documenting what the process is and how it should be used. I also built a small script to use with the project.

Now onto actually working with go. ALong the setup routine, I am installing the language using the mac installer. It detected a previous install, but I decided to overwrite it in case it's old. the `go` command line program isn't recognized, so I still had to set my path to look for it. What's the point of an installer if that doesn't already happen? 

I used https://golang.org/doc/code.html for the intro to go on this first day. Here are some tidbits that I learned.

- Each project directory should include a src, pkg, and bin directories.
- You need to set the GOPATH env variable for the project you are working in.
- You may also want to set PATH to include the bin dir of your folder for convenience.
-- PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin

All files in this project are in pkg/github.com/shortpgh/wake_up_and_go based on the suggestion from the tutorial linked above.

I skipped the install step. This didn't work right away, and I was running out of time. I'll have to dig into that in a future step.

The next step is to the  Your first library part of the tutorial linked above.

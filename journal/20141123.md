Today, I'm taking the fourth example and adding a switch statement in place of the if in the main algorithm. I haven't come up with any better changes since my last attempt. And I'm ready to move on from this problem to try something new.

This was a very easy change. It didn't require much effort. I may come back to this problem if I think of another method after working through other problems.

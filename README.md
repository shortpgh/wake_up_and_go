I have several goals for this project. The primary is to learn golang. Secondarily, I plan on using this time to learn my way around the acme editor. I also hope that this may turn into a resource that other developers can use to learn a new language -- go or anything else.

==PLAN

With the goal to learn golang, the plan is to write some small go program in the morning right after I wake up. These programs should be small -- to be completed in roughly 30 minutes. That's usually the time I have in the morning.

== PROGRAM IDEAS

=== golang tutorial

Follow the golang tutorial. This is the best place to start.

=== Write a Unit Test

Figure out how to write a unit test.

=== Code Kata's Binary Search
Write a binary search in 5 different ways (each a different day). This is a good way to learn different structural ways to create a program. It can be recursive, functional, class based, and any other method that i can think up. This also provides an introduction to a list-based data type.

=== Using Standard Libraries

Build a program that uses 3 standard libraries that haven't been used before. This forces me to learn some of the built-in libraries provided by the language. Repeat this several times, always using a set of 3 different libraries. The program doesn't have to be usable, so it could be some interesting output.

=== Use a third-party library

Pick a 3rd party library and use it. For my example, I chose Google's Analytics library. I'm familiar with the API from previous experience in other languages. This eliminates learning about the API and focus on using it in the language.

=== Use a database

Write a program that inserts and retrieves data from a database. Repeat for the different types of databases that you might use. I'm going to give both MongoDB and Postgres a try.

=== Work with files

Write a program that opens, edits, and saves text in a file. Try appending or removing specific data in the file.

=== How about CLI?

Write a program that accepts command line parameters.
